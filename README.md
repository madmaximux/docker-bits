# Docker scripts for LinuxServer.io Docker containers

These scripts can be used to easily deploy [LinuxServer.io Docker containers](https://hub.docker.com/u/linuxserver/) with predefined settings.

The scripts are based on data provided by the [LinuxServer.io GitHub repositories](https://github.com/linuxserver).

Please keep the following in mind.

- The scripts are not supported by LinuxServer.io.
- The scripts are being generated automatically, so I cannot accept requests to add scripts.

Detailed information about installing and using the scripts and more can be found [here](https://www.technorabilia.com/docker-scripts-for-linuxserver-io-docker-containers).

This repo was automatically generated from [madmaximux/generate-bits](https://github.com/madmaximux/generate-bits).
