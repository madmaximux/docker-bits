# [Dokuwiki](https://www.dokuwiki.org/dokuwiki/) is a simple to use and highly
# versatile Open Source wiki software that doesn't require a database. It is
# loved by users for its clean and readable syntax. The ease of maintenance,
# backup and integration makes it an administrator's favorite. Built in access
# controls and authentication connectors make DokuWiki especially useful in the
# enterprise context and the large number of plugins contributed by its vibrant
# community allow for a broad range of use cases beyond a traditional wiki.
